<!-- <small>Hello there! 👋, I'm...</small> -->

# Hi there,<br/>I'm Godswill Ezihe

<!-- I'm Ezihe Godswill, a frontend software engineer based in Nigeria who enjoys working between design and engineering teams to build ideas into prototypes and prototypes into living projects on the web. I'm passionate about writing clean code, optimizing existing code products for better performance and contributing to open source projects. -->
I'm  a front-end engineer from Nigeria. I build rich web experiences with modern web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. I'm passionate about building scalable and accessible front-end web and mobile applications.

Currently, I'm learning more about design systems and web accessibility. I also geek out on leetcode to solve DSA problems to keep my problem solving skills sharp and improve as a software engineer (sometimes I get stuck but it's fine you know 😄).

I don't like to brag but I've got a nice personality and chances are that you will enjoy spending time with me (you will find me troublesome sometimes I promise).
